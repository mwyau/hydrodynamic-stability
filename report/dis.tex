\chapter{Discussion}
The simple problems of Kelvin-Helmholtz instability and Holmboe
instability were investigated in this project. However, only limited
results can be done analytically. For some more complicated
problems, such as non-zero depth density shear layer, mixing of
fluids, need to be done computationally. For example, Smyth and
Winters \cite{Smyth} have done some computations on the three
dimensional time evolution of Kelvin-Helmholtz and Holmboe modes of
waves. The results are shown in Figure \ref{kh3} and Figure
\ref{ho5}. Note that there are transition from Kelvin-Helmholtz to
Holmboe mode in Figure \ref{kh3}(c).
