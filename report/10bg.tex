\chapter{Background}
Consider a function $f(x,y,z,t)$ which varies in the Cartesian
coordinate $x$, $y$, $z$ and time $t$. To find the time derivative
of $f(x,y,z,t)$ following the path of a specific fluid packet, I
define the material derivative as:
\begin{align}
    \frac{Df}{Dt} &= \frac{\partial f}{\partial t}+\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}
    \frac{\partial x}{\partial t}+\frac{\partial f}{\partial
    y}\frac{\partial y}{\partial t}+\frac{\partial f}{\partial
    z}\frac{\partial z}{\partial t}\notag\\
    &= \frac{\partial f}{\partial
    t}+(\mathbf{u}\cdot\nabla)f
\end{align}
where $\mathbf{u}$ is the velocity of the packet.

Material derivative is commonly used in the problems of fluid
mechanics.


In the following sections I will derive some important equations for
solving the problems in hydrodynamic stability.
