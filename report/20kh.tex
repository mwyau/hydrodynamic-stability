\chapter{Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability}
Kelvin-Helmholtz instability is the mode of instability at the
interface of two horizontal parallel shear flows. The velocity
profile is in general:
\begin{equation}\label{kh:pro}
\mathbf{U}(z) =
\begin{cases} U_1 \mathbf{i} &\text{if $z>0$,}
\\
U_2 \mathbf{i} &\text{if $z<0$.}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

Kelvin-Helmholtz modes of instability is well found in the nature.
Figure \ref{khphoto} shows a billow cloud with the shape of
Kelvin-Helmholtz mode of waves.
